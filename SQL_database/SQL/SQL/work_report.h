    Bugs     :

    Reflections:
        This project was very rigorous on
        understanding concepts of passing different
        items through maps and I felt it took longer
        for me to personally understand. I thought of this
        project as a good learning experience and although
        it is not fully finished, I have full intentions
        of completing this sql class.
