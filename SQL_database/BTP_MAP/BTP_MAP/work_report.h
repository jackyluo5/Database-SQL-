/*
 *     Features:
        -Not Implemented:
            iterators
        -Implemented:
            MAP and MMAP
            Pair and MPair
            BTree and B+Tree
        -Partly implemented:
            fully implemented functions
    Bugs     :
        bug free
        based off BTree and B+tree class
        functions are working
    Reflections:
        maps and mmaps were not the hard part
        it's a good way of organizing data as B+tree
        is the underlying structure.
