# Database-SQL-

•	Using C++ in QT Creator to build classes of B+ trees, B Trees, Tables, and a set of multi-maps to create a functional database and searching algorithm that mimics the functions to work exactly like MySQL. <br />
•	Created a parsing algorithm that utilized the concept of a finite state machine, reverse polish notation, and the shunting yard concept to parse through different keywords and items in a set map. <br />
•	Wrote my own finite state machine algorithm that would find keywords in a set database and return the given result after the user enters a command.
